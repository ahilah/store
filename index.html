                  manipulation, and addiction.

                    warns them to watch out for Dandelo. In his last breath Eddie calls Roland "father." Susannah stays
                    in Fedic to grieve and bury Eddie while Roland and Jake deduce where and when King is going to die.
                    Sheemie uses his powers to teleport Jake, Roland, and Oy to Stoneham, Maine, on June 19, 1999.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    To reach the badlands between Fedic and the Tower, Roland, Susannah, and Oy must travel through the
                    bowels of Castle Discordia. A monster from the todash, the space between worlds, chases them through
                    but they deter it by lighting bones on fire with a can of Sterno Susannah found in Fedic. The
                    badlands are harsh and cold, but the remains of the ka-tet arrive at Le Casse Roi Russe, the Crimson
                    King's castle.

                    A maintenance robot called Stuttering Bill brings Roland, Susannah, Patrick, and Oy to his shed from
                    Dandelo's house. He feeds them, then the foursome moves on. When Patrick draws a portrait of
                    Susannah, she asks him to erase the blemish on her face. When he does so, the blemish disappears
                    from her real face as well. Haunted by dreams of Eddie and Jake, Susannah decides it is time for her
                    to leave the quest. She asks Patrick to draw her a door. She says a tearful farewell to Roland
                    before stepping through.

                    intentional sacrifice by choosing to go on with Roland.

                    When they decide to save Stephen King, it is because the ka-tet has determined that many of the

                    lot—have been dropped into the story by the writer, and they need him to keep helping them. King
                    returns the favor with one last bit of assistance in the form of the note at Dandelo's house.

                    have become a family. Roland has shed the aloof exterior that marked his early days of the quest and
                    bonded with his ka-tet as well. He finally has the love whose absence he felt so keenly on the beach
                    in The Drawing of the Three as he watched Eddie with Susannah.

                    According to prophecy Mordred is destined to "stop the breath of the last warrior." Everyone
                    presumes this refers to Roland, as he is the last gunslinger. Of course, Mordred doesn't kill
                    Roland, but he does kill Walter. This ending could reflect the unreliability on prophecies in the
                    face of unstoppable ka. It could also reflect how prophecies are prone to misinterpretation. Walter
                    is a kind of warrior for the Crimson King, and at the point he is killed he is the last of his kind.
                    More accurately he is the only one of his kind.

              Stephen King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King.
              He made his first professional short story sale in 1967 to Startling Mystery Stories. In the fall of 1971,
              he began teaching high school English classes at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden,
              Maine.
              <br><br>
              Writing in the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories and to work on
              novels. In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co., accepted the novel Carrie for publication, providing him
              the means to leave teaching and write full-time. He has since published over 50 books and has become one
              of the world's most successful writers. King is the recipient of the 2003 National Book Foundation Medal
              for Distinguished Contribution to the American Letters and the 2014 National Medal of Arts.
              <br><br>
              Stephen lives in Maine and Florida with his wife, novelist Tabitha King. They are regular contributors to
              a number of charities including many libraries and have been honored locally for their philanthropic
              activities.
